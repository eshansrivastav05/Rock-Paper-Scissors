#Gameplay Explanation

print('''
Gamplay Rules:

You will play three rounds of rock, paper, scissors.

You will select one of the three items (rock, paper, or scissors) and the computer will also choose one

The winner of the round will earn 1 point and the next round will begins

If a tie occurs, neither the player nor the computer will receive a point and the round will be replayed

At the end of three rounds, whoever has the most points wins

You can choose to exit any time and the final score and winner will be decided on the score at the time

You may play as many times as you wish to, each time a new set of rounds begins, all points are set to 0
