A simple program which allows the user play the classic game, "Rock, Paper, Scissors" against a random number generator. The number generator or "computer" will generate a random number between 1 through 3, this will then be converted into "rock", "paper", or "scissors". The user will also choose a number between 1 through 3 and the same conversion is done. The program will then determine who has one based on the selections made and return the result to the user. The program also tracks the number of wins each side has, the first side to win 3 times is declared the overall winner.
